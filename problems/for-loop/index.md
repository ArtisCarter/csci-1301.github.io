Outstanding questions:

- I am assuming markdown syntax, but perhaps LaTeX would be better?
- do we include a solution and if yes, where? If it is not directly after the question, will need way to pair problem with its solution.
- how do we label problems? Do we label prerequisites of what is needed to answer this question?
