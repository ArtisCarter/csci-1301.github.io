# Reading From the User

#. Download the [PersonalizedWelcomeMessage project](PersonalizedWelcomeMessage_Solution.zip), extract and open it as usual.

#. If you are using Visual Studio on Mac or Monodevelop, you may have to perform an additional step for this program to run as expected.
    
    - For Visual Studio on Mac, follow the instructions at <https://stackoverflow.com/a/49056993/> to have your project "Run on external console".
    - For Monodevelop, follow the instructions at <https://stackoverflow.com/a/67185469/> to similarly have your projeect "Run on external console".

    You may have to perform this operation for every solution where the user is supposed to enter values.

#. Compile and execute it.
#. The user of your program (in this case, you!) will be prompted with the message:

        Please, enter your first name, followed by "Enter":
    
    Enter your first name, followed by <kbd>Enter â†µ</kbd>.
    You just witnessed an interaction between a program and the user!

#. Read the source code carefully and make sure you understand all of it.
#. Change the code so that the program would also ask for the user's last name and print both their first and last names.
