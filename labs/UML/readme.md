## Conception 

<! -- TODO: we should use different class here, since PreciseRectangle is already done in PreciseRectangle lab -->

Draw the UML diagram of a PreciseRectangle class: it should have two attributes, of type `double`, and eight methods:

- two setters, two getters (i.e., one for each attribute), 
- one method to compute the area of a precise rectangle,
- one method to compute the perimeter of a precise rectangle,
- one method to swap the length and the width of a precise rectangle,
- one method to multiply the length and width of a precise rectangle by an ratio given in argument as an integer.


# Pushing Further (Optional)

The following is an independent task, to widen your understanding of this class, and to prepare you for the next labs.

#. Class diagrams (the ones we will be using) are just a special case of UML diagram.
Have a look at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language#Diagrams>.
In which category are class diagrams: behavior, or structure diagram?
Have a look at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_diagram> and try to read the example of activity diagram for a guided brainstorming process.
