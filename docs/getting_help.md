The School has a tutoring center that can be reached:

## ACM Club

The [Augusta University chapter](https://spots.augusta.edu/cyberdefense) of the [A.C.M](https://www.acm.org/ "Association for Computing Machinery") is one of the university's best resources for Computer Science, Information Technology and Cyber Security students.
It provides a platform to network with other students in similar majors, presenting countless opportunities to not only expand the people you know, but also a fantastic place to learn and ask questions.
To learn more, you can sign up for the newsletter, or attend one of the subgroup meetings (meeting times and locations are listed [on the website](https://spots.augusta.edu/cyberdefense)).

## Other Club Activities

The Augusta University Game Design Club and Girls Who Code College Loop "will be continuing activities in full force this year".  Notifications for upcoming activities will be shared in class alongside school-wide emails.
