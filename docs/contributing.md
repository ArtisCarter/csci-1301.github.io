TODO: 

- [ ] How to contribute to this repository

    - one time changes can be submitted by opening a PR
    - submitting feedback is also contributing; we should discuss the instructions for doing that here
    - how to become a member of a contributing team (inctructors/UCAs); maybe some way to request invite?
    - do we add outside collaborators as collaborators (this is a Github permission/role and allows committing changes without forking) 

- [ ] How to become a UCA

<!-- or maybe two separate documents? -->
<!-- Yes. -->
