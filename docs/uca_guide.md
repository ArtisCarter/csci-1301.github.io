<!-- this is a comment, it is only visible when editing this markdown document -->

<!-- to add images to this document:

1. add image under img/ directory
2. refer to it using the following syntax:

   !["image description here"](img/image_filename.png)

   the exclamation in front is important.

   If you "preview" the markdown in github editor, images may not display in the preview.
   This is not a concern, just make sure the path to image is correct.
