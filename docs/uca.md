# What Is an Undergraduate Course Assistant?


In this course, an Undergraduate Course Assistant (UCA) is generally present in addition to your instructor.
A UCA is a student, generally in the School of Cyber and Computer Sciences, that successfully passed CSCI 1301 and that is hired by the School to assist other students.

Their duties generally include:

- Helping the students during the labs,
    - To set-up their computers,
    - To find the right resources,
    - To understand your IDE's error messages,
    - To investigate bugs with you,
    - etc.
- Helping the students outside of the lab (through email, teams, or office hours), for similar tasks as in lab, but also to get ready for an exam or a quiz,
- Reporting to the instructors any issue, mistake or confusion they noticed,
- Suggesting improvmemts to the resources shared with the students.

Their duties _can not_ include:

- Understanding for you^[Althought that may sound curious, we believe it is important to remind you of the fact that they can only _help_ you understanding, but that you have to do your part!],
- Helping you or even commenting on graded material _before_ it was graded,
- Helping you with other classes,
- Helping you becoming a self-regulated learner and work on your schedule^[That's a job really well taken care of by the [Academic Success Center](https://www.augusta.edu/academicsuccess/)!].

# How Do I Become One?

A UCA is hired by the School upon recommendation of instructors, after discussion with our Academic Program Coordinator, and possibly our Director of Undergraduate Studies.

A UCA _must_:

- Be a student, that is, currently enrolled in courses, or, if during the Summer, being enrolled in courses for the next Fall semester,
- Pass our Human Resources background check,
- Have an interest in tutoring,
- Understand clearly the limitations and limits to the help they can provide to students.

Additionally, if a student want to help with this particular class, then of course they have to have successfully passed CSCI 1301.

A UCA will:

- Be able to work up to 20 hours/week, payed $12/hours, without other benefits,
- Be adequately trained to use our platforms and edit our resources,
- Be able to work on Campus and discuss their schedule with their referent instructor,
- Develop a stronger bond with the instructors, facilitating possible future reference or research projects.

So, in short: talk to any CSCI 1301 instructor if you feel like applying!
