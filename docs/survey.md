title: Survey and Statistical Analysis
---


# Purpose

At the beginning of CSCI 1301 and of CSCI 1302, the students are asked to complete a short, anonymous survey that does not count toward their grade.
Why?
Primarily for 3 reasons:

- This project is [supported](about.html#Supports) by [Affordable Learning Georgia](https://www.affordablelearninggeorgia.org/), that is proud of its [Data Center](https://www.affordablelearninggeorgia.org/about/data): this survey will contribute to their statistics and analysis on students savings, retentions, and perception of open educational resources.
- We want to assess if the student cohort has basic understanding of basic notions at the beginning of CSCI 1301 and at the beginning of CSCI 1302 (with the hope that we see significant progress, of course!). It also helps the CSCI 1302 instructor to gauge the level of the students and adapt their delivery if needed.
- Finally, we strive to maintain an open line with our students, and want to get you used to sharing your opinion with us.

# Outcomes

The numerous suggestions we received from our students, being through end-of-semester student evaluation or more informal mid-semester survey already greatly helped shape the content of CSCI 1301.
Among notable improvments resulting from students' feedback, we can note:

- The development of this website and of all its ressources, to gather in one place free (both as in "free cofee" and "free speech") material,
- The adaptation of our [software installation](software_install.html) guide to more operating systems and IDE,
- A better integration of the lab into the lectures,
- And many more!
