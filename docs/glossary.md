keywords/ reserved words:
~  words defined by the C# language and
    used for one thing

data types:
~  categories in C# used to define types of values, such
    as strings

Variable:
~  values that be changed

Constant:
~  values that can not be changed

Identifier:
~  words defined by the programmer to refer to an object
    or variable.

Operations:
~ 

Operators:
~  symbols used to perform operations

Modulo:
~  the % used to divide two numbers and return the remainder

escape sequence:
~  used to represent a non-printable character

reference types (objects and strings) - a variable of a class object
    holds a reference to the address of the object on the managed heap.

value types (all other reserved words)

numeric types

Booleans:
~  a binary datatype that can only be true or false

decision structures (if/else/switch)

control structures (loops)

instantiation (instance of a class) - the act of creating a object,
    an instance of a C# class

Initialization:
~  the act of both declaring a variable's datatype
    and identifier and assigning it value

Declaration:
~  the act of creating a variable's datatype and
    identifier

Assignment:
~  the act of giving a value to an identifier

implicit conversion:
~  the act of automatically storing the value of
    one identifier into another identifier that differs from its own

explicit conversion (casting) - the act of storing the value of one
    identifier into another identifier that differs from its own using
    additional syntax

legal/illegal values

Rules/conventions - Rules are required syntactical ways to write a
    program for it to function. Conventions are not required for the
    program to function, but are heavily encouraged for the readability
    and comprehension of other programmers

format specifiers (C, N, P, E) -

Constructor:
~  a method used to instantiate an object and assign
    it's attributes

Parameter:
~  any variable declared within a method

Argument:
~  any value that must passed to a method in order for it
    to be called

Attribute:
~  the variables declared within a class to act as the
    characteristics of any of its instantiated object

Method - a code block that contains a series of statements

class member (attributes and methods) - anything defined within a
    class that can be access within and outside of the class

Scope:
~  Time and place in program where the variable exists

Iterator - an object that traverses an array or list

sentinel value - a special value in the context of an algorithm
    which uses its presence as a condition of termination, typically in
    a loop or recursive algorithm.

guard condition - boolean expressions (predicates) found at the top
    of a method or function that determine whether the function should
    continue to run.

Accumulator:
~ 

Counter:
~  a variable used to count the number of times a certain
    condition is met

complex condition

method signature:
~  the way a computer reads a method by its name
    and the datatype of its parameters

method overloading:
~  the act of creating multiple methods with the
    same signature

return type:
~  the datatype of any value returned from a called
    method

UML diagram:
~  a written diagram used to display a class and all of
    its members

input validation:
~  whenever a program checks if the user gave a
    usable input and responds accordingly to avoid errors
    implementation
