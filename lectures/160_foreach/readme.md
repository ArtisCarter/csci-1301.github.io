# foreach Loop
In C#, some objects can store several other objects. Arrays are one of them. The `foreach` statement provides an easy way to execute a statement or a block of statements for each element stored in an object.

## Syntax
The general syntax of using the _foreach_ statement is as follow:
```
foreach(Type ItemName in CollectionName)
{
   // the code for processing the ItemName
}
```
- #Type#: The type of items in the collection
- #ItemName#: The chosen item is accessible using ItemName
- #CollectionName#: The name of the collection
