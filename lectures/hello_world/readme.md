### Block quote examples


Short

> If you automate a mess, you get an automated mess.

Longer

> Programming without an overall architecture or design in mind is like exploring a cave with only a flashlight: You don’t know where you’ve been, you don’t know where you’re going, and you don’t know quite where you are.
