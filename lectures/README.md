# Lecture Notes

This directory contains all lecture notes. CSCI 1301 Book is generated from the contents of this directory.

**Creating new lectures**

When creating a new lecture, let's call it `lecture xyz`:

1. first create a directory called `lecture_xyz`, follow the existing pattern
2. under that directory, create an `readme.md` and write notes there

Following these steps will automatically include the new lecture in the book. Do not include
meta section in individual sections because they will be concatenated. The overall [meta data file is here](/templates/meta.md).
