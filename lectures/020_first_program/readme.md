# First Program

_The students should understand all the components of a simple "Hello World" program:_

<!-- all code blocks need titles -->

```
!include code/hello_world.cs
```

- Comments (in line and block)
- `using` statements and namespace / API concepts
- blank lines and spacing
- indentation
- intro to classes and methods' structures (body / header)
- status of `main` method 
- intro to Console's `Write` and `WriteLine`
- string literal

### Rules and Conventions

- The difference between a "rule" (e.g. case-sensitivity) and a "convention" (commenting your code).
- Reserved words
- Identifiers and naming conventions
- That the distinction can vary with the programming language
- Importance and role of `{` and `}`
